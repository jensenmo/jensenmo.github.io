**Disclaimer:** I am not a medical professional. This is my personal story of a 20-year journey with digestive health issues, and it may not be relevant to your situation. What worked or didn't work for me should not be taken as medical advice. This is simply a tale of persistence, suffering and the search for answers that others with similar unexplained symptoms might find useful.

## Background

I am writing this post because I have spent the past 20 years being told I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), a diagnosis that never quite fitted the full picture. In August 2025, I finally discovered what was actually going on: I tested positive for both Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO) and Intestinal Methanogen Overgrowth (IMO). After successfully treating the IMO, with persistent SIBO, I am now self-treating SIBO, and whilst the journey is far from over, I wanted to document how I got here.

This is arguably a cautionary tale about the limitations of "diagnosis by exclusion" and the importance of persistence when something doesn't feel right. I'll be honest - symptoms have been severely affecting my overall life, my business and especially my family. If you're reading this because you've been living with similar unexplained digestive issues, I hope my experience might provide some useful insights.

## Where it all started: Australia, 2005

In late 2005, I took a 7-week trip to Australia and New Zealand. Towards the end of the trip, after scuba diving and staying on a boat for a few days at the Great Barrier Reef near Cairns, things began to go wrong. I developed hives on my chest and joints, followed by blood in my stool and significant fatigue and weakness. I was administered oxygen on the flight home - not exactly how you want to end a holiday.

What followed were symptoms that would become frustratingly familiar over the next two decades: bloating, flatulence, acid reflux, occassional dizziness and fatigue. The kind of fatigue that makes you wonder if you've developed some exotic parasitic infection from your travels.

## First diagnosis: IBS, 2007

Back in the UK, where I lived at the time, I had my first colonoscopy in 2006. The results were inconclusive - the bowel wasn't fully cleared, and they mentioned something about a "long bowel". Not particularly illuminating. In 2007, a doctor suggested it was IBS, specifically IBS with constipation. I was essentially told to manage the symptoms and get on with life and saw a clinical dietitian who prescribed eating certain types of food and to reduce coffee intake.

For several years, I tried to do just that. The symptoms would wax and wane, sometimes better, sometimes worse. I learned to avoid certain foods - red meat, duck and MSG (think: Indian dinners in London...) caused spectacular flatulence and smells. Garlic, and tomatoes would trigger bloating, stomach soreness, acid reflux, often within 15-60 minutes - even insomnia might follow. Constipation became a regular companion with 4-5 days of no action at times.

## The active years and their slow decline

Through the late 2000s and into the 2010s, I remained quite active despite the symptoms. I ran marathons and half-marathons up until 2018/19. Looking back, I suspect the wellness and routine helped manage some of the symptoms.

But around 2014, a new symptom emerged that would prove more debilitating: fatigue, occasionally accompanied by brain fog. The fatigue was peculiar in its timing - it would hit especially hard after lunch and sometimes after dinner. The post-lunch episodes were often the most impactful because the afternoon would be spent in a daze.

Later, in the 2020's, this pattern would start happening in the morning for 1-2 hours after getting up.

I saw a couple of GPs about the fatigue. Their response was remarkably consistent: fatigue is often not diagnosed, and I should basically learn to live with it. They did blood tests, which were relatively normal, but beyond that no action. Not particularly encouraging when you're struggling to stay awake at your desk in the afternoon whilst running an IT consulting business.

## The 2019 flare-up: a glimpse of something more

In 2019, things escalated significantly. I developed hives on my joints again, reminiscent of the 2005 episode. This time, they were accompanied by severe fatigue, cramps, soreness and flu-like symptoms with joint pains and lasted for several months. During this period, I also experienced brain fog and slight dizziness.

This prompted my second colonoscopy with a gastroenterologist in a private hospital in Ireland. Unlike the first inconclusive examination, this one found something: aphthous ulcers and inflammation, including inflammation of the ileocecal (IC) valve - the valve between the small and large intestine. Finally, some objective findings.

However, the doctor took over two years to provide a formal conclusion, eventually putting it down to... IBS again, in 2022. The ulcers and inflammation were apparently not significant enough to warrant more tests, a different diagnosis or treatment approach.

I was sent on my way with a low FODMAP sheet of things to eat and not to eat. And that was that.

In the end the symptoms eased but, needless to day, the diet never quite resolved anything and in the end I stopped. I just avoided the foods I already knew to be triggers and later I added things like Nutella and artificial enhancers/preservatives such as Sulphites to this list. Not from any particular process but rather from the symptoms I would experience overnight or the day after.

## 2020: blood markers and iron deficiency

In the second half of 2020, blood tests showed elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) - a marker of inflammation - and iron deficiency with low serum iron and transferrin saturation. I was frequently fatigued. These tests were never repeated until 2025, when they had normalised. I can't help but wonder what might have been caught if there had been more systematic follow-up.

During this period, I was also diagnosed with asthma in 2018 (after breathing tests due to frequent chest infections), mild-to-moderate sleep hypopnoea in 2021, and rhinitis with post-nasal drip in 2023 following a bout of vertigo. Looking at the list now, I can see a pattern of inflammatory and respiratory issues that likely weren't coincidental.

My activity levels declined further. My partner noticed the change from 2023/2024 - someone who used to run marathons could now barely negotiate himself out the door to walk the dog at lunch.

## 2025: the year everything came to a head

Between mid-May and the end of October 2025, I lost over 10kg. The weight loss was partly due to symptoms and lack of appetite and partly due to starting a low FODMAP diet in early July on the recommendation of a clinical dietitian. The diet took six weeks before I saw any constipation improvements in late August, but there was little improvement to all the other symptoms. Come end October I am still on the low FODMAP diet, awaiting a consultation with my clinical dietitian to determine when I can gradually start re-introducing even just gluten. It has been a tough few months on this diet.

In June 2025, a sample found VTEC DNA (a pathogenic E. coli strain) and elevated calprotectin at 265 (normal is under 50). By July, the VTEC DNA had cleared, but calprotectin remained elevated at 68. I'd also tested positive for ANA (antinuclear antibodies) at a titre of 1:160, which can indicate autoimmune activity. My GGT and cholesterol had been mostly elevated over the past seven years. The inevitable question from doctors was "do you drink a lot of alcohol?" to which the answer was always a firm "No!", I really don't.

Additional symptoms had developed: a metallic taste on the tip of my tongue every day since May, foul breath (according to my partner), occasional greasy skin and acne. When stomach symptoms were bad, the tinnitus intensity increased considerably. The symptoms could keep me awake for an hour or longer at night, or wake me up to five times per night.

In June 2025, a skin prick test showed I'd developed allergies to silver birch, trees, mould and grass pollen - a test in 2018 had been negative. Even my immune system seemed to be changing.

By this point, the list of foods I could tolerate was also shrinking.

## The breakthrough: SIBO and IMO testing

Frustrated with the lack of answers, in August 2025 I started extensive research with Claude to see how my symptoms might fit various possible diagnoses. It was a painstaking endeavour taking up countless hours of my time of asking the same questions from different perspectives to see what would stick. A learning lesson is not to take the first AI/LLM answers as gospel but instead to keep digging - ask the same things from different angles and ask it to rate likelihoods of the different possible diagnoses. SIBO (I was not yet aware of IMO as a separate entity) had come up on a number of occassions in my research and at one point my clinical dietitian also mentioned SIBO and H.Pylori as possible options.

Not knowing that I could get a breath test in Ireland through self-referral, I actually went ahead and bought the [FoodMarble Aire 2 device](https://foodmarble.com/store/foodmarble-aire-2) in August, following some additional research, which measures methane and hydrogen in my breath. Note that this is not the only device on the market but from an Irish location perspective it was the easiest, quickest and cheapest to get.

I received the device on Monday the 8th of September and immediately downloaded the app, paired the device and took my first breath test. My breath test lit up immediately, methane was constantly elevated at 50-100ppm, even reached 150ppm post-meal, and hydrogen was hovering around 20-30ppm.

I mentioned this to my clinical dietitian with screenshots a couple of days later and she said "This is interesting." and that for the test to be taken seriously by the medical profession, I should go to [GastroLife](https://gastrolife.ie/terminology/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-sibo-test/) for a breath test.

I was lucky. I rang up GastroLife and they happened to have an appointment the day after and I rang early enough in the day that I could follow the 24-hour pre-test instructions. So I started fasting and drove up for the test on a Thursday. 2 work days later, on a Monday, the test was returned - the results were fairly conclusive; evidence of SIBO and IMO:

![Gastrolife Breath test results](images/sibo_imo_breath_test.png)

The chart should be read as follows:

* You are asked to breathe into a balloon at 0 min, drink a Lactulose (or Glucose) solution, breathe into a new balloon again at 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 and finally 120 min.
* I drank Lactulose. [Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK536930/) - or sugar - that does not occur in nature. The [human small intestinal mucosa does not have the enzymes to split lactulose](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4175689/), so it passes unchanged through the small intestine where bacteria (if SIBO/IMO is present) ferment it, producing hydrogen and methane gases
* When bacteria ferment lactulose in the small intestine, the hydrogen and methane gases produced are [absorbed across the intestinal lining into the bloodstream, transported to the lungs and exhaled in the breath](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4175689/) where they can be measured - this is the basis for breath test diagnosis
* For Hydrogen (H2) the test should be read as follows: For Lactulose >= 20 rise over baseline within 90 minutes is considered positive (mine was 47-50 over baseline of 6 at 90 min and rose to 73 over baseline at 120 min)
* For Methane (CH4) the test should be read as follows: >= 10ppm at baseline or at any point during the test is considered positive for methanogenesis (mine started out at baseline 50, fell a bit and then rose to 67 at 120 min)

For me personally, drinking the solution resulted in major activity in my stomach, gurgling, cramp, a feeling of being unwell as well as much increased tinnitus intensity. This lasted a couple of days.

After 20 years of being told I had IBS, which essentially means "we don't know what's wrong with you, but it's probably not serious" - I finally had a specific, testable diagnosis.

**SIBO** (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth) occurs when bacteria that normally live in the large intestine colonise the small intestine inappropriately. According to [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21820-small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-sibo), this can cause bloating, abdominal distension, constipation or diarrhoea, fatigue and malabsorption of nutrients - leading to deficiencies in vitamins and minerals that affect energy levels and overall health.

**IMO** (Intestinal Methanogen Overgrowth) is the excessive growth of methane-producing archaea (single-celled microorganisms) in the gut. Research from [Cedars-Sinai](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/newsroom/gut-microorganism-may-play-a-role-in-constipation/) shows that these archaea produce methane gas which slows intestinal transit, directly contributing to constipation. Patients with IMO commonly experience bloating, constipation, abdominal pain and flatulence.

The inflamed IC valve found in my 2019 colonoscopy now took on new significance from my own research. Research published in the [World Journal of Gastroenterology](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3520169/) shows that IC valve dysfunction is strongly associated with SIBO - when the valve fails to maintain adequate pressure, it allows bacteria from the large intestine to reflux backwards into the small intestine where they don't belong. A dysfunctional valve may explain not only how SIBO develops but also why it can persist or recur even after antibiotic treatment.

Suddenly, the constipation made sense (methane slows gut motility). The bloating and flatulence made sense (bacterial fermentation). The fatigue and brain fog made sense (bacterial metabolites can affect energy and cognition). Even the pattern of symptoms worsening after meals made sense (more food = more fermentation).

The diagnosis didn't answer every question - the elevated GGT, the autoimmune markers, the gallbladder polyps, the new-onset allergies - but it provided a framework that IBS never had.

## A concerning consultation: when evidence meets resistance

In late September 2025, armed with my breath test results, I attended a consultation with a gastroenterologist at a public HSE hospital. The encounter was deeply troubling.

She became visibly angry that I had taken a SIBO breath test with GastroLife and presented the results to her. The hospital, she stated firmly, only practises "evidence-based medicine" and doesn't recognise such breath tests. She also didn't recognise IMO as a diagnosis. The irony was difficult to miss - GastroLife's testing protocols follow the [North American Consensus on hydrogen and methane breath testing](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5418558/), published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology in 2017, which established standardised, evidence-based criteria for diagnosing SIBO and methane overgrowth using breath tests. The consensus states clearly that breath testing is "a useful, inexpensive, simple and safe diagnostic test" for these conditions.

I had brought a 3-page brief summarising my 20-year history and listing questions at the end. As we went through it together - she read it whilst I tried to clarify along the way - her demeanour changed. It was at this point that she seemed to realise her hostile behaviour was unwarranted and that I was simply a patient desperately looking for answers after two decades of symptoms. To her credit, she apologised for the outburst.

She then prescribed rifaximin and neomycin - but suggested taking them in sequence rather than in parallel. According to published research, including a [2010 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19996983/) showing 85% clinical response rates, these antibiotics should be taken together (rifaximin 400mg three times daily plus neomycin 500mg twice daily for 10 days). Her prescription was for two tablets daily - significantly under the evidence-based dosing.

I raised concerns about neomycin's well-documented ototoxicity, particularly given my existing tinnitus and history of vertigo. Neomycin is known to have the [greatest cochleotoxic effect of all antibiotics](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8239227/), with potential hearing damage that is typically permanent. I suggested metronidazole as an alternative, which many gastroenterologists routinely prescribe instead of neomycin. She dismissed this concern entirely.

The encounter highlighted a broader issue: the HSE and also the private sector and some of its gastroenterologists (at least 2 that I visited) appear not to be keeping pace with evolving diagnoses (both SIBO and now IMO has been recognised in gastroenterology literature for years) or current treatment protocols. When a patient presents with published research and legitimate test results, the response should arguably be engagement with the evidence, not dismissal.

I decided to hold off on treatment. I had an appointment scheduled for early October at a private hospital in Dublin with an associate professor of gastroenterology for a second opinion. After this HSE consultation, waiting seemed the prudent choice.

## A different kind of consultation: complexity acknowledged

In early October 2025, I attended my appointment at the private hospital with the professor, bringing along my now well-used 3-page brief summarising my 20-year history, symptoms, test results and questions.

Her response was immediate and markedly different from my previous experience. She recognised straight away that I was a "quite complex" case. However, she also gave out to me for not having sent the brief and supporting test results in advance. I stated that had I known that this was an option (first time ever that a doctor asked me for this), I would of course have provided all of the documentation and brief up front. With the complexity of the case, she needed time to review everything properly rather than trying to digest it all during the consultation itself.

Despite the short consultation, she quickly reviewed some of the documentation and made what seemed like a pragmatic assessment: "I guess we start by treating you for SIBO and IMO and then we see what's left to treat." It was a refreshingly straightforward approach - address the confirmed diagnoses first, then reassess to see what symptoms remained and what might require further investigation. She put me on rifaximin and metronidazole, both 3 tablets a day.

She promised to review all the documentation thoroughly and issue a letter outlining her diagnoses, recommended further tests and treatment protocols. This systematic approach felt like progress after 20 years of fragmented care.

Four weeks on from that consultation, I am yet to receive the letter. I contacted her secretary two weeks after the appointment, and was told that the letter is still being worked on - that my caseis "quite complex". Whilst the delay is frustrating, I can appreciate that a thorough review of two decades of medical history, multiple test results and interconnected symptoms takes time. The acknowledgement of complexity is, in itself, a form of validation that my experience has previously lacked.

## When the cure feels worse than the ailment

Following the consultation on 1st of October, I began the prescribed treatment: rifaximin and metronidazole, both three times daily. The professor had switched me from the sequential dosing to parallel administration and replaced neomycin with metronidazole to avoid ototoxicity risks given my existing tinnitus.

What followed was arguably the most challenging fortnight I'd experienced in this 20-year journey.

Within days, the side effects became severe. By day three, I was experiencing what the SIBO community calls "die-off" - the reaction as bacteria are killed and release toxins. Extreme fatigue sets in, accompanied by dizziness and brain fog so profound that basic tasks felt like wading through molasses. Working became an exercise in endurance rather than productivity.

By day seven, the symptoms had escalated alarmingly. Whilst my tinnitus had initially dropped to the lowest level in perhaps 15 years - a brief, tantalising glimpse of what treatment success might feel like - it then spiked dramatically. I developed tingling in my hands and cold extremities, cognitive impairment anxiety. My blood pressure, normally around 120/78, jumped to 160/95. The sensation in my head felt wrong - a kind of disorienting numbness and confusion.

On day eight, I reached breaking point. After another largely sleepless night, I asked my partner to drive me to the private hospital emergency department. I tried to explain the constellation of previously mentioned symptoms - with anxiety and an overwhelming sense that something was seriously wrong.

The emergency doctor's response was deflating. Blood tests showed nothing alarming. In a roundabout way, he made it clear he felt I'd wasted his time, finishing the consultation with "I hope to never see you again" - a statement with an unmistakable dual meaning. Whilst I understood his frustration, I hadn't known what else to do. The side effects were well beyond what I'd anticipated, and I'd received virtually no guidance on what to expect during treatment. The rifaximin had come with no information sheet, the pharmacist hadn't discussed side effects and the prescribing doctor had effectively washed her hands of such details, stating that discussing food timing and side effects was "the pharmacist's job".

Reassured - in a strange way - that nothing immediately life-threatening was happening, I continued treatment but reduced the metronidazole to twice daily from three, trying to find a tolerable balance between treating the overgrowths and maintaining basic function.

Over the following week, symptoms gradually improved. By day 12, I was starting to feel much more lucid.

Looking back on those two weeks of antibiotic treatment, the phrase "the cure was worse than the ailment" feels apt. The lack of proper medical guidance, the dismissive attitude when complications arose highlighted how poorly understood and supported SIBO/IMO treatment remains within conventional medical practice.

The last 3 days of the treatment followed by 2 additional days, were probably some of the best days I've experienced in years from a cognitive perspective. My head was bursting with energy and there was no tiredness evident post-lunch/walk. It was extremely invigorating even if the body was still recovering from the onslaught.

Then, on day 18, a new challenge emerged: SIBO rebound. IMO was gone according to the Aire 2 device but SIBO hydrogen readings went up and up. They never really came down during treatment and on day 3 of treatment when methane levels crashed to near-0 the hydrogen readings went up by a factor of 2-3 as a baseline - and peaked at a whopping 120ppm. The severe fatigue and brain fog returned with a vengeance. Acid reflux, constipation intensified, metallic taste on tongue returned and I developed constant thirst. By mid-afternoon, I felt quite faint. It appeared the bacteria were recovering, undoing whatever progress the antibiotics had achieved.

At this point, I had already previously researched herbal protocols with proven medical and scientific basis. In desperation I took up the research again to come up with a suitable treatment protocol seeing as I couldn't get in contact with the professor to determine what to do.

## The herbal protocol: a self-devised approach

Faced with partial antibiotic treatment setback, I developed my own herbal protocol based on research into SIBO management and motility restoration. I started this treatment on day 21, not expecting much.

On day 23 I was amazed to find that suddenly late afternoon, my thirst and the metallic taste on my tongue disappeared and the brain fog suddenly started lifting. Breath tests showed that hydrogen ppm was crashing. Only 48 hours earlier, did hydrogen peak at 120ppm but this day the max reading peaked at 29.

On day 24 the die-off of bacteria hit me like a brick. I was ok in the early morning but after breakfast and the tablets, I suddenly got a full migraine, dizziness, more brain fog and significant nausea to the point that I thought I would get sick. This lasted until lunch before the symptoms calmed down a bit and I decided to skip berberine for the rest of the day just to give my body a chance to clear the die-off toxins.

Day 25, the ppm crept back up to 49ppm but 2 hours after continuing NAC + berberine it crashed again to 5ppm. I felt fatigued, a bit dizzy and a bit unwell. This extended into day 26.

I have to admit that I am generally very skeptical about "herbal remedies" but because this regimen was backed by publicly available research I felt that I had nothing to loose. Give it a try and see what happens...

The effects have been profound. So far, much of the brain fog has disappeared. I am still feeling some fatigue and dizziness after taking tablets - and I can feel the body is hard at work fighting infection and tired. But extremely positive results!

I can't wait to complete the course and hopefully get on with my life - while trying not to look back too much with a feeling of bitterness or regret.

I have created a chart that clearly shows the Aire 2 readings per day both pre-treatment and during treatment with relevant annotations:

![FoodMarble Aire 2 breath tests](images/aire_2_breath_test_analysis.png)

The herbal course included several components:

**Dietary modification:** Aside from continuing on the low FODMAP diet, I reduced daily carbohydrate intake from my usual 225g to 175g, substituting with increased protein and healthy fats. The rationale was simple - reducing the carbohydrate substrate available to hydrogen-producing bacteria might help starve the overgrowth whilst maintaining adequate nutrition.

**Ginger for motility (500mg, 3x daily):** An important element was ginger supplements to restore the Migrating Motor Complex (MMC) - the wave-like contractions that sweep through the small intestine between meals, preventing bacterial accumulation. Research using [gastroduodenal manometry](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10442508/) (a test that measures pressure and contraction activity in the stomach and small intestine) has shown that ginger enhances motility response to meals. The MMC dysfunction is linked with SIBO development, so restoring this "intestinal housekeeper" function seemed fundamental to long-term management. I took one tablet half an hour before breakfast and dinner - and one before bed - an indefinite protocol aimed at re-establishing normal motility patterns.

**NAC as biofilm disruptor (600mg, once daily):** N-acetylcysteine serves a different purpose - disrupting the protective biofilms that bacteria create to shield themselves from antibiotics and immune responses. A [systematic review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25339490/) demonstrated that NAC both inhibits biofilm formation and destroys established biofilms, significantly promoting antibiotic penetration to deeper layers. I took 600mg half an hour before breakfast for a planned 4-6 week course, aiming to break down bacterial fortifications before the antimicrobials attacked.

**Berberine as natural antimicrobial (1000mg, 3x daily):** Berberine became my primary antimicrobial agent. The [BRIEF-SIBO trial](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2023.1121435/full) is investigating whether berberine is non-inferior to rifaximin for SIBO treatment, using 800mg daily dosing. I opted for slightly higher dosing at 1000mg three times daily with meals for 4-6 weeks, based on protocols used in various herbal SIBO treatments. Unlike broad-spectrum antibiotics, berberine appears to selectively promote beneficial bacteria whilst reducing pathogenic overgrowth.

**Saccharomyces boulardii for gut healing (3x daily with meals):** This probiotic yeast became my gut restoration agent. Unlike bacterial probiotics, S. boulardii is [unaffected by antibiotics](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7344949/) and can be taken alongside antimicrobial treatment. Research shows it works through multiple mechanisms: binding and eliminating pathogens, producing antimicrobial compounds, strengthening the intestinal barrier and modulating immune responses. Studies specifically examining SIBO found that S. boulardii reduced bacterial overgrowth and improved digestive symptoms whilst restoring intestinal microbiota. I planned a minimum 4-6 week course, potentially continuing long-term given its safety profile.

This protocol represented a fundamentally different approach - addressing not just bacterial overgrowth but also the underlying motility dysfunction that allows SIBO to develop and recur.

## Conclusion

This blog post is intentionally not complete and I plan to make future material updates.

Here are the key takeaways from my journey:

* Trust your Gut (pun intended). If there's one thing I've learned from these 20 years, it's this: trust your body when something doesn't feel right. Don't stop asking questions when answers don't fully fit the symptoms. Sometimes "IBS" is just the beginning of the story, not the end. If you make no progress with your current health consultant, perhaps it's time to do research and find someone who will. Claude is a really powerful researcher and is well worth the monthly subscription while you undergo diagnosis and treatment
* Don't waste time on doctors or consultants who won't help you find a proper, holistic diagnosis for your symptoms. Some will gaslight you, suggesting it's all in your head or that you should simply "learn to live with it". Others will be outright dismissive or hostile when you present research or test results they're unfamiliar with. I understand that cynicism and scepticism creep into medical practice - consultants see many patients and perhaps develop a defensive posture - but this is no excuse for fobbing people off or becoming hostile when confronted with their own gaps in knowledge. Your time, health and wellbeing are too valuable to spend years with practitioners who aren't listening. If a consultant becomes angry at you for seeking answers, that's a sign to move on, not a sign that you're wrong
* If you have symptoms that resemble SIBO or IMO - chronic bloating, constipation or diarrhoea, fatigue, brain fog, food intolerances - consider getting a breath test. In Ireland, you can self-refer to [GastroLife](https://gastrolife.ie/terminology/small-intestinal-bacterial-overgrowth-sibo-test/) without needing a GP referral. If the breath test comes back positive, or if you have significant food intolerances, I'd strongly recommend getting the [FoodMarble Aire 2](https://foodmarble.com/store/foodmarble-aire-2) device (or similar) for ongoing monitoring. It measures hydrogen and methane levels in your breath and allows you to track patterns, log symptoms (fatigue, bloating, constipation), record food intake with built-in low FODMAP scoring and even record sleep quality. This data becomes invaluable for identifying food triggers and measuring treatment progress - I used it during my journey and it provided objective evidence of what was working and what wasn't
* Based on the Aire 2 device, I found that reducing carbohydrates in my meals - compensating instead with protein and fat for calories - helped me keep bacterial growth to a minimum during herbal treatment as it reduced the daily ppm scores consistently and considerably. I personally targeted 175g of carbohydrates a day, down from a "normal" target of 225g
* Make sure to approach any self-diagnosis or self-treatment with appropriate caution and medical oversight. My journey has involved numerous consultations, a second opinion and extensive research. What I'm documenting here is my experience, not medical advice.
