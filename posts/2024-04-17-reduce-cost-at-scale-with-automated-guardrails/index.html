As organisations continue to grow and with the resulting increases in AWS consumption there is a need to be able to cost-effectively scale not just workloads but also governance and guardrails to ensure that security requirements are met across the estate.
A key requirement to move quickly to expand and improve services and products in AWS is to enable developers to work unhindered while establishing a set of guardrails that ensure safe operation of workloads.">

<p>Virtuability has worked closely with organisations to considerably improve governance and guardrails throughout the AWS estate, which includes automation to ensure that accounts, workloads and teams are automatically covered.</p>
<p>The portfolio of solutions is a mix of out-of-the-box AWS capabilities combined with a range of tools that minimise overall operational overheads. The tools and capabilities include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An AWS Organizations account structure rooted in team structure and the development lifecycle combined with Control Tower for general governance and guardrails of AWS estate and users</li>
<li>Automated deployment of bespoke and Control Tower Preventive, Proactive and Detective controls across the organisation in a unified configuration, which is achieved transparently on an Organisational, OU and account level</li>
<li>Automated AWS SSO (IAM Identity Center) deployment of permission sets, customer-managed policies and account assignments as teams change, new accounts are provisioned or existing accounts are moved within the Organisational structure</li>
<li>EC2 &amp; container Image Builder factory with automated build, hardening, test and publishing of a unified set of hardened OS flavours (25+) that are shared with and used across the organisation. Adding new or removing old, hardened OS flavours is a simple and very time-efficient process</li>
<li>Automated, unified pipeline roles factory that automatically distributes deployment pipeline roles across the organization. Includes a set of guardrails to ensure correctness of policies and permissions</li>
<li>Unified set of Cloud Development Kit (CDK) &amp; Cloudformation Bootstrap Stacks, roles and policies that separate landing zone concerns from application workloads through a combination of IAM paths, Permissions Boundaries and Security Control Policies</li>
<li>A split of landing zone, deployment and app/services workload roles and resources by leveraging IAM policy and role paths and leveraging permission boundaries, which allows developers to have more permissions within well-established boundaries</li>
<li>Regular, automated reporting of aggregate Security Hub findings has enabled the organisation to identify and correct problematic workloads on a risk/impact basis</li>
</ul>

</h2>
<p>Through the new tools and capabilities, organisations have improved governance and security posture considerably while scaling AWS consumption at the same time.</p>
<p>This has led to a hands-off approach in provisioning new accounts, guardrails, SSO permission sets etc.</p>
<p>Many previously manual and laborious challenges have been eliminated over time, which has allowed the IT Operations &amp; Security teams to instead focus on other business objectives and the future.</p>
