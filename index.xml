      <description>I am a senior hands-on IT professional and tech leader with more than 25 years of IT experience. I have extensive experience with AWS Cloud, DevOps, automation, migration, integration, databases etc.
On a personal level I enjoy running and the odd game of golf when I don&amp;rsquo;t have my head stuck in a book or busy tinkering with a Raspberry Pi.</description>

      <description>Background With the advent of the Raspberry Pi 4, Pi&amp;rsquo;s have sufficiently powerful in terms of both CPU and memory for AWS development. Furthermore, AWS has recently made significant headway in the Arm space with the release of Graviton-based EC2 and support for Arm 64-bit (aarch64) with the following services:
 AWS CodeBuild Amazon EKS worker nodes (beta preview) AWS ECS (for EC2) ARM AMIs  Currently, there&amp;rsquo;s no known way to run Amazon Linux 2 on a Raspberry Pi (but AMI&amp;rsquo;s will run on Graviton-based EC2 instancesin AWS).</description>

      <description>Background It&amp;rsquo;s much faster to be able to develop and debug AWS Glue / PySpark scripts locally.
The Developing and Testing ETL Scripts Locally Using the AWS Glue ETL Library instructions describe installation but are not complete. There are certain dependencies to consider to make this work.
Also note that the version of PySpark used (2.4.3) for Glue 1.0 does not support:
 Python 3.8, which Ubuntu 20.04 comes with. Therefore some of the PySpark code needs to be hacked a bit as per Stackoverflow and Gist.</description>
